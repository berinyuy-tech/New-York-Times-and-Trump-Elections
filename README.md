# New York Times' Coverage of Trump

My project looks at the New York Times' coverage of Trump from when he announced his candidacy to August 2016 (the date of the project). I gathered approximately 2,200 news articles from the Times that focused on Donald Trump and used topic modeling to map how the topics of the articles have evolved over the past year. I also did a piece of work(Analysing and Modeling the New York Times and Trump) documenting my analysis process, topic modeling, and findings whick is found in this github repository.
